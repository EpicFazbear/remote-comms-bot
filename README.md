# Remote Communications Bot

A heavily modified version of my original Heavy Dictator discord bot.
This bot's main purpose is communicating to the remote admin server for sending messages/commands to linked Roblox games (Using a certain plugin that reads messages from the server).

- Requires [Luvit](https://luvit.io/) and [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia) in order to run.
- Configurable in the .env file

I may or may not release the Roblox scripts I made to make a full connection between Roblox and Discord. (They're not that hard to replicate anyways) As of now (when this repository becomes public), the code for this bot and for the remote server are available for use.
