# Remote Communications Bot

A heavily modified version of my original Discord Lua bot.
This bot's main purpose is communicating to the remote admin server for sending messages/commands to linked Roblox games.

**[!]** I'm preparing to soon release the Roblox scripts I made to make the full connection between Roblox and Discord. Once I release it, more instructions as well as a link to the Model will be added in this README file.

- Requires [Luvit](https://luvit.io/) and [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia) in order to run. (Only if you run this on your computer)
- Configurable in the .env file. (Only if you run this on your computer)

+ It is recommended to use [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) to run this bot. It can even be hosted externally 24/7 (Granted you keep watch of your monthly free hours). There's some additional steps you'll need to do, all of which is documented in the tutorial right below.

# Setup Tutorial
**TODO:** *I still have to write the down.
<br>
I'll get around to it eventually, but in the meantime, if you already know a bit about how Discord bots work, the setup should be pretty straight-forward.*
