# Remote Communications Bot

A heavily modified version of my original Discord Lua bot.
This bot's main purpose is to act as a communicatory webserver and Discord bot for transmitting messages/commands between linked Discord text channels, and Roblox chat.

**[!]** I've released the Roblox scripts needed to make the full connection between Discord and Roblox. You can get and set them up from here: https://www.roblox.com/library/6946681003/Webhook-Webserver-Module
<br>
Detailed instructions upon how to set this up will (hopefully) be added to this README soon.
<br>
<i>(Feel free to help me out on a fork if you want to!)</i>

- Requires [Luvit](https://luvit.io/) and [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia) in order to run. (Only if you are running this on your computer)
- Configurable in the .env file. (Only if you are running this on your computer)

+ It is recommended to use [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) to run this bot. It can even be hosted externally 24/7 (Granted you keep watch of your monthly free hours). There's some additional steps you'll need to do, all of which is <i>(yet to be)</i> documented in the tutorial right below.

# Setup Tutorial
**TODO:** <i>I still have to write the down.</i>
<br>
<i>I'll get around to it eventually, but in the meantime, if you already know a bit about how Discord bots work, the setup should be pretty straight-forward.</i>
